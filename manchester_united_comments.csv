!PING FIXTURE-GUIDE,3,What To Watch This Week (21-27 October)
"&nbsp;

In **1. Bundesliga**, the first top match is probably one with a foregone conclusion:

&nbsp;

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 15_30h local time:  
**Leipzig – Freiburg** 

While this top duel (2nd v. 3rd) is probably the game to watch this matchday, an upset seems unlikely. Leipzig have superhuman defensive capabilities and they have yet to lose a game this season. Freiburg are rather unlikely to be the team that break Leipzig’s streak and should be seen as a bit of an underdog in match.

&nbsp;

In the other top-match (**Union v. Frankfurt**, see OP above), Frankfurt should be seen as favourites, but it is an away game after all. At any rate, after yesterday’s loss in Leverkusen, Frankfurt cannot really afford to lose another game as they would slip too far in the table.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Those who enjoy a ton of goals much more than a game between equals, the **Bochum – Bayern** game is the one to watch, as this is the kind of game that usually ends 0:8 or something…. [SUN, Oct 27th ---- 15:30 local time]

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Two of the games listed in the OP above feature four teams that fall in the “should do better” category:

**Augsburg – Dortmund**   
**Mainz – Mönchengladbach**  

Dortmund fans wish their team would play better, more secure football; and bring in points against weaker opponents convincingly rather than just by scraping by. And the other three teams should really rank a bit higher in the table with a slightly more comfortable points haul than they currently have.

Of the four coaches, the ones of Dortmund and Gladbach are probably under much more pressure than those of Augsburg and Mainz.

&nbsp;

Talking of coaches under pressure: while Hoffenheim have shown signs of life recently, Matarazzo’s job is still very much in danger:

SUN, Oct. 27th ---- 19:30h local time:  
**Heidenheim- Hoffenheim**

But Hoffenheim’s game against Heidenheim will be interesting for more than another reason as well: Both teams are playing in European competitions, and with Hoffenheim’s form and psychology being all over the place, and Heidenheim still being a very small club, it will be interesting to see which of the two will begin to show some signs of wear and tear.

BTW; both are playing their European games on Thursday, and both will have to travel equally far, so no advantage/disadvantage for anyone.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-----------------

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

4 top-matches in **2. Bundesliga**…:

FRI, Oct. 25th ---- 18:30h local time:  
**Köln – Paderborn** [10th v 5th]    

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 13:00h local time:  
**Karlsruhe – Hertha** [2nd v. 7th]  
**Elversberg – HSV** [8th v. 3rd]  

SUN, Oct. 27th ---- 13:30h local time:  
**Magdeburg – Hannover** [4th v. 6th]  

&nbsp;

…and also 3 matches involving the lower third of the table:

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 13:00h local time:  
**Schalke – Fürth** (first match at home for Schalke’s new coach)  

SUN, Oct. 27th ---- 13:30h local time:  
**Darmstadt – Ulm** (Darmstadt are playing very strong under their new coach)  
**Braunschweig – Münster**

"&nbsp;

There is an “English Week“ in **3. Liga**, with matchday 11 being played on Tuesday/Wednesday and matchday 12 over the weekend.

&nbsp;

There will be two top matches on matchday 11: 

TUE, Oct. 22nd ---- 19:00h local time:  
**Aue – Cottbus**

WED, Oct. 23rd ---- 19:00h local time:  
**Wehen Wiesbaden – Dresden**

&nbsp;

There will also be too bottom-of-the-table duels:

WED, Oct. 23rd ---- 19:00h local time:  
**Essen – Verl**  
**1860 München – Osnabrück** 

&nbsp;

Three days after their match against Verl, Essen will see another duel against a direct competitor on matchday 12:

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 14:00h local time:  
**Rostock – Essen** 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

------------------

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In 4th-tier **Regionalliga Südwest**, FSV Frankfurt managed to expand their lead as Offenbach and Walldorf stumbled.  
With Homburg losing against FSV, and with Walldorf and Stuttgarter Kickers both drawing their games, Steinbach Haiger have now sneaked into 5th place.

&nbsp;

FSV and Offenbach are both facing relatively easy opponents on the weekend, and Walldorf and Steinbach-Haiger will face each other (meaning one or both of them will be dropping points). This could be the moment the top of the table stretches further and moves away from the “runner-up” group. Although the very strong second teams of Hoffenheim and SC Freiburg are still in the mix as well (just less exciting).

FRI, Oct. 25th ---- 19:00h local time:  
**Offenbach – Giessen**  

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 14:00h local time:  
**FSV Frankfurt – Villingen**  	
**Steinbach Haiger – Walldorf**

&nbsp;

Also, a mid-table fight between two regional heavyweights:  

SUN, Oct. 27th ---- 14:00h local time:  
**Eintracht Trier – Stuttgarter Kickers**

If Trier win this, they will be equal on points with Stuttgart, thus cementing both teams in mid-field. But the Kickers will hope to win this, in order to keep somewhat in contact with the top of the table. Again, with Walldorf and Steinbach-Haiger playing against each other, three points would benefit Stuttgarter Kickers greatly, no matter how the game in Haiger ends.

"I said nothing about GvB, I knew he’d be much better than Şenol, Rıza or Santos.

Personally I was hyped about Mou. However it’s getting worse and worse and he showed no indications of playing more attacking football.

The season is already done, I’m not expecting much",6,"[Nexus Sports] Jose Mourinho after being asked ""Fenerbahçe won in Istanbul when you were in charge of Manchester United.

I hate seeing this because I really liked him as a manager but he is clearly stuck back in 2011 still and is refusing to change his ways.,8,"[Nexus Sports] Jose Mourinho after being asked ""Fenerbahçe won in Istanbul when you were in charge of Manchester United.

"I think a lot of it is due to Fener's board telling him those even before the league started. First week of the season he already said ""I see that the things that I was told about this league were true"".

Fener's board a 100% believes there's a conspiracy against them, it makes sense for Mourinho to use the same excuses.

Fener's president has reportedly tons of yes-men around him, which hurts the club more than anything else.",7,"[Nexus Sports] Jose Mourinho after being asked ""Fenerbahçe won in Istanbul when you were in charge of Manchester United.

I don't even think the tactics being outdated is his problem. I think he is just not that into it anymore. Would probably be different if he was coaching the Portuguese national team.,1,"[Nexus Sports] Jose Mourinho after being asked ""Fenerbahçe won in Istanbul when you were in charge of Manchester United.

Yeah my colleague doesn't like your president either but I don't think it's fully because of the football.

"Good performance from Garnacho, Rashford, and Hojlund today

Maybe next time our medical team can wrap up a bleeding player or something to avoid having to take them off 3 fucking times",109,Post Match Thread: Manchester United 2-1 Brentford | English Premier League
"Rashford was actually kinda insane in this match, especially his tracking back. I don’t know what happened, but I hope he can keep this level of effort through the whole season.",141,Post Match Thread: Manchester United 2-1 Brentford | English Premier League

Semi retired Jonathan Grant Evans is the best centre back in the league.,137,Post Match Thread: Manchester United 2-1 Brentford | English Premier League
"A lot of positives today. Garnacho was unstoppable in the second half, this was Casemiro's best performance this season, Rashford was great today, Hojlund's link up play was very good today and he scored a great goal.

As a United fan I'm just taking one game at a time but I was very pleased with our second half performance. I just wish we didn't play so pragmatic in the first half and let Brentford have all of the ball. It was nice to see United attackers press more in the second half.",46,Post Match Thread: Manchester United 2-1 Brentford | English Premier League
"One of the weirdest performances from Brentford I’ve ever seen, seemed like they weren’t arsed. 

Licha at left back was outstanding, took Mbuemo out the game completely, Jonny Evans continues to be our most important defender, best he’s ever played for us atm. Dalot a lot better on his preferred side. 

Still not perfect, lots of gaps in midfield but I can’t think of anyone who was poor today. Zirkzee was a bit shit when he came on but was very isolated",87,Post Match Thread: Manchester United 2-1 Brentford | English Premier League
