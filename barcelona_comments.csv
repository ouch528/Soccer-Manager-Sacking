"&nbsp;

In **1. Bundesliga**, the first top match is probably one with a foregone conclusion:

&nbsp;

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 15_30h local time:  
**Leipzig – Freiburg** 

While this top duel (2nd v. 3rd) is probably the game to watch this matchday, an upset seems unlikely. Leipzig have superhuman defensive capabilities and they have yet to lose a game this season. Freiburg are rather unlikely to be the team that break Leipzig’s streak and should be seen as a bit of an underdog in match.

&nbsp;

In the other top-match (**Union v. Frankfurt**, see OP above), Frankfurt should be seen as favourites, but it is an away game after all. At any rate, after yesterday’s loss in Leverkusen, Frankfurt cannot really afford to lose another game as they would slip too far in the table.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Those who enjoy a ton of goals much more than a game between equals, the **Bochum – Bayern** game is the one to watch, as this is the kind of game that usually ends 0:8 or something…. [SUN, Oct 27th ---- 15:30 local time]

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Two of the games listed in the OP above feature four teams that fall in the “should do better” category:

**Augsburg – Dortmund**   
**Mainz – Mönchengladbach**  

Dortmund fans wish their team would play better, more secure football; and bring in points against weaker opponents convincingly rather than just by scraping by. And the other three teams should really rank a bit higher in the table with a slightly more comfortable points haul than they currently have.

Of the four coaches, the ones of Dortmund and Gladbach are probably under much more pressure than those of Augsburg and Mainz.

&nbsp;

Talking of coaches under pressure: while Hoffenheim have shown signs of life recently, Matarazzo’s job is still very much in danger:

SUN, Oct. 27th ---- 19:30h local time:  
**Heidenheim- Hoffenheim**

But Hoffenheim’s game against Heidenheim will be interesting for more than another reason as well: Both teams are playing in European competitions, and with Hoffenheim’s form and psychology being all over the place, and Heidenheim still being a very small club, it will be interesting to see which of the two will begin to show some signs of wear and tear.

BTW; both are playing their European games on Thursday, and both will have to travel equally far, so no advantage/disadvantage for anyone.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

4 top-matches in **2. Bundesliga**…:

FRI, Oct. 25th ---- 18:30h local time:  
**Köln – Paderborn** [10th v 5th]    

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 13:00h local time:  
**Karlsruhe – Hertha** [2nd v. 7th]  
**Elversberg – HSV** [8th v. 3rd]  

SUN, Oct. 27th ---- 13:30h local time:  
**Magdeburg – Hannover** [4th v. 6th]  

&nbsp;

…and also 3 matches involving the lower third of the table:

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 13:00h local time:  
**Schalke – Fürth** (first match at home for Schalke’s new coach)  

SUN, Oct. 27th ---- 13:30h local time:  
**Darmstadt – Ulm** (Darmstadt are playing very strong under their new coach)  
**Braunschweig – Münster**

There is an “English Week“ in **3. Liga**, with matchday 11 being played on Tuesday/Wednesday and matchday 12 over the weekend.

&nbsp;

There will be two top matches on matchday 11: 

TUE, Oct. 22nd ---- 19:00h local time:  
**Aue – Cottbus**

WED, Oct. 23rd ---- 19:00h local time:  
**Wehen Wiesbaden – Dresden**

&nbsp;

There will also be too bottom-of-the-table duels:

WED, Oct. 23rd ---- 19:00h local time:  
**Essen – Verl**  
**1860 München – Osnabrück** 

&nbsp;

Three days after their match against Verl, Essen will see another duel against a direct competitor on matchday 12:

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 14:00h local time:  
**Rostock – Essen** 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

------------------

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In 4th-tier **Regionalliga Südwest**, FSV Frankfurt managed to expand their lead as Offenbach and Walldorf stumbled.  
With Homburg losing against FSV, and with Walldorf and Stuttgarter Kickers both drawing their games, Steinbach Haiger have now sneaked into 5th place.

&nbsp;

FSV and Offenbach are both facing relatively easy opponents on the weekend, and Walldorf and Steinbach-Haiger will face each other (meaning one or both of them will be dropping points). This could be the moment the top of the table stretches further and moves away from the “runner-up” group. Although the very strong second teams of Hoffenheim and SC Freiburg are still in the mix as well (just less exciting).

FRI, Oct. 25th ---- 19:00h local time:  
**Offenbach – Giessen**  

SAT, Oct. 26th ---- 14:00h local time:  
**FSV Frankfurt – Villingen**  	
**Steinbach Haiger – Walldorf**

&nbsp;

Also, a mid-table fight between two regional heavyweights:  

SUN, Oct. 27th ---- 14:00h local time:  
**Eintracht Trier – Stuttgarter Kickers**

If Trier win this, they will be equal on points with Stuttgart, thus cementing both teams in mid-field. But the Kickers will hope to win this, in order to keep somewhat in contact with the top of the table. Again, with Walldorf and Steinbach-Haiger playing against each other, three points would benefit Stuttgarter Kickers greatly, no matter how the game in Haiger ends.

"The two most exciting games in **1. Bundesliga** will be without doubt the Saturday games in Leverkusen and Munich (see OP above). But there is also some drama on offer in Sinsheim (Hoffenheim) and Gladbach:

&nbsp;

SAT, Oct. 19th, 15:30h local time:  
**Hoffenheim - Bochum** ------ both teams are sitting at the bottom of the table (16th and 18th), and at least Hoffenheim definitely don't belong there. They have been struggling on the pitch and are being distracted by a lot of drama going on in the club internally. But they have recently been able to steal a point from Hoeneß's Stuttgart and have beaten Dynamo Kiew in the Europa League. A win at home against Bochum is nevertheless an absolute necessitiy if their coach wants to keep his job.  
**Mönchengladbach - Heidenheim** ------ Gladbach are also struggling much more than they should and their coach is definitely on the shortlist for ""first dismissal of the season"". And apart from a home win against Union Berlin there have been very few reasons recently to feel confident about a team that is currently only 2 points ahead of Hoffenheim. While their oppenents from Heidenheim are impressive, they still are a small town team and Gladbach fans will absolutely expect a win against them at home.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On a simlar, but perhaps less dramatic note, there is this game which features two teams whose fans expect better (similar to Hoffenheim and Gladbach):

&nbsp;

SUN, Oct. 20th, 17:30h local time:  
**Wolfsburg - Bremen** ------ it's a bit of a battle of the middling teams when the green-on-white W meets the white-on-green W. They sit in 12th and 11th position with 7 and 8 points respectively (so only 1 and 3 points ahead of Gladbach), but I don't think anyone is calling for the head of their manager's (yet). Still, a game neither can afford to lose which should get some spice into the game.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---------------

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In **2. Bundesliga**, perhaps the single-most one-sided match of the day when the table leaders are travelling to meet the hopelessly outclassed bottom team:

&nbsp;

SAT, Oct. 19th, 13:00h local time:  
**Regensburg - Düsseldorf**	

&nbsp;

So with Düsseldorf expected to pick up another 3 points, it is up to the competition not to screw up. The most interesting game in this respect will also be the top duel of the day, 2nd vs 5th:

SUN, Oct. 20th, 13:30h local time:  
**Hamburg - Magdeburg**

The other top teams (Karlsruhe, Paderborn, Hannover) have easier games on paper, but Paderborn will certainly not find much fun in having to play away at Kaiserslautern.

&nbsp;

Generally an interesting set of constellations in this league, as (like Hannover) all teams from the upper midfield are facing off against lower-ranked teams in matches that they sort of ""must"" win, but could also easily lose. A loss means losing sight of the top-spots, and in the worst case you might find some bottom-of-the-table teams breathing down your neck. Either way, these also are ""remote duels"" for both the mid-level and the bottom-level teams, as all the teams that are sitting right next to them in the table are involved in similar matches:

FRI, Oct. 18th, 19:00h local time:  
**Darmstadt - Köln**  
**Hertha - Braunschweig**

SAT, Oct. 19th, 13:00h local time:  
**Hannover - Schalke**  
**Münster - Elversberg**

Mixed bag for both Hertha and Köln. Both are in a more comfortable table position than their opponents. And Hertha have the advantage of playing at home. 
Hertha are volatile at the best of times, and Braunschweig have proven recently that they have not given themselves up completely. Almost the same could be said about the other Friday game: Köln are not 100% stable, while Darmstadt have proven that they still have plenty of fight left in them. Also, Darmstadt have the home advantage in this one.

Likewise, Hannover could easily lose to Schalke, and Münster could easily beat Elversberg. So, thankless games all round for the ""favourites"", as these are games they are expected to win, but they are all games that could easily go the other way.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On a side-note, one of the oldest football rivalries in Germany will see another installment:

SUN, Oct. 20th, 13:30h local time:  
**Fürth - Nürnberg** ------ both are on equal points right bang in the centre of the table which makes this one interesting and unpredictable.

In **3. Liga**, a top-end duel between the table leaders Sandhausen and 4th-placed Cottbus:

SAT, Oct. 19th, 14:00h local time:  
**Cottbus - Sandhausen**

&nbsp;

Since either Cottbus or Sandhausen (or both) are going to drop points, this is the chance for their competition. And as three of the other teams at the top are facing ""easier"" opponents, this makes those matches must-win games for them:

**Bielefeld** [7th] - **Osnabrück** [20th] (SUN, Oct. 20th, 16:30h local time)

**Mannheim** [16th] - **Aue** [5th] (FRI, Oct. 18th, 19:00h local time)

**Wehen Wiesbaden** [3rd] - **Hannover II** [19th] (SAT, Oct. 19th, 14:00h local time)

&nbsp;

The remaining contenders (Dresden, Saarbrücken, Viktoria Köln) have slightly harder tasks in front of them:

**Viktoria Köln - Borussia Dortmund II** (SAT, Oct. 19th, 14:00h local time)

**VfB Stuttgart II - Saarbrücken** (SAT, Oct. 19th, 16:30h local time)

**Dresden - Essen** (SUN, Oct. 20th, 13:30h local time)

Towards the lower end of the table, four teams (all on between 9 and 11 points) eager not to slip any lower:

**Ingolstadt - Verl**

Mens Football, **4th tier**:

In **Regionalliga Nord**, there will be a top duel between 3rd placed **Kickers Emden** and runaway table leaders **TSV Havelse** [SAT, Oct 19th, 18:00h local time]. With one or both of them going to drop points, the competition could benefit, especially second-placed Drochtersen/Assel who will face the current bottom team of the table:

SUN, Oct 20th, 14:00h local time:  
**Todesfelde - Drochtersen/Assel**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A similar constellation in **Regionalliga Südwest**. 6th-placed Homburg, who just got trashed by 2nd-placed Offenbach 5:1 two days ago, will get a chance to redeem themselves in their home game against table leaders FSV Frankfurt. Should Frankfurt lose this, Offenbach could benefit, as they are only 2 points behind and are expected to win against Villingen, who are second from the bottom. Astoria Walldorf should also be able to benefit from the Homburg-Frankfurt game (no matter how it ends), as they are on equal points with Homburg and can be expected to win their home game against 13th-placed Göppingen:

FRI, Oct 18th, 19:00h local time:  
**Homburg - FSV Frankfurt**

SAT, Oct. 19th, 14:00h local time:  
**Walldorf - Göppingen**  
**Villingen - Offenbach**  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In **Regionalliga Bayern**, the top 6 are facing off in three games that are all happening on Friday (Oct 18th, 19:00h local time):

**Bayreuth** [2nd] - **Burghausen** [4th]  
**Würzburg** [3rd] - **Schweinfurt** [1st]  
**Bayern München II** [6th] - **Illertissen** [5th]

&nbsp;

***Note:*** *München's B-team is currently 3 games behind for some reason. Either way, they are always a contender. Burghausen is one game behind, which will be played on October 15th (against a weak opponent); so by the time the Friday games are happening, Burghausen may have jumped into second place and pushed Bayreuth and Würzburg down one spot. But that also means that Burghausen will have had little rest compared to Bayreuth, putting the guests at an additional disadvantage.*
